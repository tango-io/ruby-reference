## Inheritance

Inheritance is when an object or class is based on another object or class" (from Wikipedia)

```
class HowardStark
  def say_hello
    puts "I'm amazing"
  end
end

class TonyStark < HowardStark
end

ironman = TonyStark.new
ironman.say_hello
```

We created a subclass using class `TonyStark < HowardStark`. The `<` notation means we’re creating a subclass of the thing on the right; the fact that we use less-than presumably signals that the child class is supposed to be a specialization of the parent.

Note that the child class defines no methods, but when we create an instance of it, we can call say_hello. That’s because the child inherits all the methods of its parent.

## Modules

Modules are a way of grouping methods, classes, and constants together. Modules give you two major benefits:

  * Provide a namespace and prevent name clashes. <== how is that they prevent name clashes?
  * Modules support the mixin facility.


```
module Trig
  PI = 3.141592654

  def sin(x)
  end

  def cos(x)
  end
end
```

Now we are able to include this module in our class

```
class Math
  extend Trig
end

Math.cos(12)
```

## Mixins

Modules have another wonderful use. At a stroke, they pretty much eliminate the need for inheritance, providing a facility called a mixin.

You can include a module within a class definition. When this happens, all the module’s instance methods are suddenly available as methods in the class as well (there is some difference depending on if you use "include" or "extend" that I think it's worth to mention here). They get mixed in. In fact, mixed-in modules effectively behave as superclasses.

```
module Flyer
  def fly
    puts "I believe I can fly"
  end
end

class Bird
  include Flyer
end

class Plane
  include Flyer
end

piolin = Bird.new
jayjay = Plane.new

piolin.fly
jayjay.fly
```
